# 2017_tracker

This repo is used to track my progress in the year 2017. Who can stop you from using GitHub
for any crazy thing other than your terrible code.

# How it works.

I will have an issue opened, [#1](https://github.com/nu11p01n73R/2017_tracker/issues/1) which will contain the various things I hope to improve 
in the year of 2017. This issue will remain open for the entire year, and will be 
close on 31st December 2017 with the analysis of how those points in listed in the
issue where improved upon.

In addition to the main issue, monthly issues will be opened on the last day of the 
previous month which contains the what is planed for the next month. The issue for
the current month will be closed on the last day of the month.

# Why is this a thing.

We all have had new year resolutions taken with great hopes. But most of us find ourselves
lost even before the first month. This is a different approach I hope will throw you
out of your comfort zones. The fact that this document is publicly available forces
you to do something about it. It makes you answerable at the end of month/year why
didn't I do anything about this which I boast would be improved. 

# Why github

WHY NOT.

I liked the the way issues are grouped in github. You can have a single issue and track them
which multiple other issues. I thought of having a blog post, but then I hated the part
of editing the blog post at every month and adding your progress.
